This upgraded port scanner goes beyond simple port detection by integrating multiple cybersecurity features. 
It identifies whether the target system is running Windows or Linux, extracts detailed information about services operating on open ports, and checks for known vulnerabilities using an external database or API. 
By implementing multithreading, it significantly speeds up scanning, making it efficient for large-scale assessments. 
Additionally, it logs all scan results into a file, allowing for later analysis and documentation. 
These enhancements make it a powerful tool for cybersecurity professionals looking to analyze network security and identify potential threats.
